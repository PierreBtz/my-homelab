# My homelab

This repository contains the configuration of the services running on my homelabs with a few utils
I'm developing to simplify my life along the way.

The purpose of this repo is:
* to maintain my stack as code
* to have some minimal documentation about what I do

I'm making this public in the hope that it can help other folks getting started.
While I'm trying to keep things as generic as possible, the main goal is not reuse, but rather be a source of inspiration.
